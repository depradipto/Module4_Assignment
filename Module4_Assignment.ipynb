        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        " - Function is a reusable block of code used for specific task. Whwereas, a method is a function which is assosiated with object or class and operates on the object they are called upon.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        " - Arguments pass values when called upon and parameters are variables are used when defining a function. For example- Argument: a= sumit \\n print( 'hello' + a). Parameter : def add(a,b) \\n return a+b  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        " -  Some of the ways of calling a function are lambda, map, reduce and functions with or without parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        " - the purpose of a return statement is to return and work values of an already defined function with parameters. example: def add(a,b): \\n return a+b.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        " - Iterator is an object representing a string of data and return the data one by one and Iterable is any pyhton object/sequence string/data structure that is capable of returning its members one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        " - Generators work by returning one by one istead of returning in one go. yeild is a generator.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        " - Someo of the advantages of using generator over egular functions are Efficcient memory ussage, SImple syntax, infinte sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        " - Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword.\n",
        " They are used for creating small, throwaway functions without the need to formally define a function using def.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        " -  The map function applies a given function to all items in an input iterable and returns an iterator with the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python? list:[47,11,42,13];\n",
        " - map() transforms each element of an iterable by applying a function.\n",
        "reduce()aggregates all elements of an iterable into a single value by applying a function cumulatively.\n",
        "filter() filters elements of an iterable based on a condition, returning only those that meet the condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation usingÂ  reduce function on this given list:[47,11,42,13];\n",
        " - first iteration = 47+11 = 58\n",
        "   second iteration = 58+42 = 100\n",
        "   thiird iteration = 100+13 = 113\n",
